        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ecomena.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/water-pollution.jpg?ssl=1/600x400" alt="Reduce Water Pollution" style="width: 60%;">
    
        <p>
            There are many ways to reduce water pollution, including proper waste disposal, using eco-friendly
            products, and raising awareness in your community. Share your suggestions with us!
        </p>
        <h1>1. Industrial Waste</h1>
        <img src="https://www.netsolwater.com/netsol-water/assets/img/product-images/industrial-waste-water-treatment-effluent-treatment-plant-manufacturer-9650608473.jpg" alt="Reduce Water Pollution" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>Industries and industrial sites across the world are a major contributor to water pollution. Many industrial sites produce waste in the form of toxic chemicals and pollutants, and though regulated, some still do not have proper waste management systems in place. In those rare cases, industrial waste is dumped into nearby freshwater systems. When industrial waste is not treated properly (or worse, not treated at all), it can very easily pollute the freshwater systems that it comes into contact with. 

          Industrial waste from agricultural sites, mines and manufacturing plants can make its way into rivers, streams and other bodies of water that lead directly to the sea. The toxic chemicals in the waste produced by these industries not only have the potential to make water unsafe for human consumption, they can also cause the temperature in freshwater systems to change, making them dangerous for many water dwelling organisms.</p>
          <h1>2. Marine Dumping</h1>
          <img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1638892026/EducationHub/photos/water-pollution.jpg" style="width: 60%">
          <p>The process of marine dumping is exactly what it sounds like, dumping garbage into the waters of the ocean. It might seem crazy, but household garbage is still collected and dumped into oceans by many countries across the world. Most of these items can take anywhere from two to 200 years to decompose completely.</p>
          <h1>3. Sewage and Wastewater</h1>
          <img src="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16x9_100/public/media-uploads/guide_waterpollution_66615937_2400.jpg.jpg?h=0289cdca&itok=b5FHpTeN" style="width: 60%">
          <p>Harmful chemicals, bacteria and pathogens can be found in sewage and wastewater even when it’s been treated. Sewage and wastewater from each household is released into the sea with fresh water. The pathogens and bacteria found in that wastewater breed disease, and therefore are a cause of health-related issues in humans and animals alike. </p>
          <h1>4. Oil Leaks and Spills </h1>

          <p>The age-old phrase “like water and oil” is used when describing two things that do not mix easily or at all. Just as the saying states, water and oil do not mix, and oil does not dissolve in water. Large oil spills and oil leaks, while often accidental, are a major cause of water pollution. Leaks and spills often are caused by oil drilling operations in the ocean or ships that transport oil.  wildlife. </p>
          <h1>5. Agricultural runoff</h1>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Sediment_runoff_NRCS_2016a.jpg" style="width: 60%">
          <p>In order to protect their crops from bacteria and insects, farmers often use chemicals and pesticides. When these substances seep into the groundwater, they can harm animals, plants and humans. Additionally, when it rains, the chemicals mix with rainwater, which then flows into rivers and streams that filter into the ocean, causing further water pollution. </p>
